            <strong>Vol I</strong> (or Volume 1) represents the first deck in that series, and is inspired from <strong>Aries</strong>, <strong>Taurus</strong>, <strong>Gemini</strong> and <strong>Cancer</strong>.

            It is a deck that is designed to be used for <strong>cardistry</strong>, <strong>magic</strong>, and <strong>poker</strong> or any other <strong>card games</strong>.

          <p class="section__paragraph">
            We are a 2 person team, based out of <strong>Delhi NCR (India)</strong>, that is passionate about playing cards.
          </p>
          <p class="section__paragraph">
            We noticed that collecting well-designed and themed playing cards is a hobby that has been growing all around the globe, especially in the last 5 years.
          </p>
          <p class="section__paragraph">
            While India isn't lagging behind in collectors (that is YOU guys! üòç), it is trailing when it comes to production.
          </p>
          <p class="section__paragraph">
            So we decided to do something about it, and the result was <strong>White Fang Cards</strong>.
